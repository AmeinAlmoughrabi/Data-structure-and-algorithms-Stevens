This lecture aims to implement three types of deletion algorithms.

> Given we have the following BST T
>	      50 
>     /    \  
>		30     70 
>		/ \     / \ 
>	 20 40   60 80 

Please perform: 
- Delete vertex 20 from the tree T. Return the updated tree T'
- Delete 30 from T' which will return an updated tree T''
- Delete 50 from T''.
