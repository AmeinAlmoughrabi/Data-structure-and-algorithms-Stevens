This lecture aims to implement three types of deletion algorithms.

> Given we have the following BST T
>       50 
>     /    \  
>    30     70 
>   / \     / \ 
>  -1 40   60 80 
> / \ / \  / \ / \
> -1.......

Please perform: 
- Delete vertex 40 from the tree T. Return the updated tree T'
- Delete 30 from T' which will return an updated tree T''
- Delete 50 from T''.

Note, -1 means null child.
