# CPE 360 Data Structure and Algorithm

This course focuses on understanding and implementing a variety of data structures ranging from basic to advanced, primary algorithms, and time and input/output complexity analysis. The purpose of this course to not only learn those data structures, but also implement them in C/C++ program.
